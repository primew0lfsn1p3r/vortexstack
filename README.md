# vortexstack
VortexStack is an all-in-one reconnaissance engine built for speed and visual clarity. It automates the "Golden Trio" of the ProjectDiscovery stack—discovery, validation, and vulnerability scanning—into a single, resilient pipeline. Designed by hunters, for hunters, it handles the "boring" parts of recon so you can focus on the bugs.
